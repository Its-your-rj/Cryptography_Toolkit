# Cryptography Toolkit

Welcome to the Cryptography Toolkit, a comprehensive web-based resource for exploring classical and modern cryptographic techniques. This toolkit is designed for learners, educators, and professionals who are interested in understanding and analyzing various encryption methods, their vulnerabilities, and practical applications.

## Features Overview

The Cryptography Toolkit consists of three main sections:

### 1. Cipher Selection

Explore the following ciphers and cryptographic protocols:

- **Caesar Cipher**: A classical substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number of places.
- **Affine Cipher**: A more complex substitution cipher using linear functions.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword for encryption.
- **Columnar Transposition Cipher**: A method of rearranging plaintext based on a fixed column order.
- **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix.
- **Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES)**: A lightweight version of the DES algorithm for educational purposes.
- **Feistel Cipher**: A symmetric structure used in many modern encryption algorithms.
- **Rail Fence Cipher**: A transposition cipher using a zigzag pattern.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
- **RSA Encryption**: A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm based on modular arithmetic.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: A cryptographic protocol where one party proves knowledge of a value without revealing it.

Each cipher or protocol is accompanied by an intuitive interface for inputting plaintext, keys, and other necessary parameters. Users can see the encryption or decryption process in action.

### 2. Code, Cryptanalysis, and Possible Attacks

Dive deeper into each cipher or protocol with:

- **Implementation Code**: Well-documented source code for each cipher to help users understand the underlying algorithms.
- **Cryptanalysis**: Insights into the weaknesses of each method and how they can be exploited.
- **Possible Attacks**: Common attack techniques such as brute force, frequency analysis, and man-in-the-middle attacks are explained with examples for relevant ciphers and protocols.

This section is an excellent resource for understanding the practical limitations of cryptographic systems and their security implications.

### 3. Simulation Tools (Under Development)

Future versions of the Cryptography Toolkit will include interactive simulation tools for each cipher and cryptographic protocol. These tools will provide:

- **Visualization of Encryption/Decryption**: Step-by-step animations of how the algorithms process the data.
- **Attack Simulations**: Demonstrations of cryptanalysis and various attacks in real-time.
- **Parameter Exploration**: Adjustable settings to test different key sizes, plaintext inputs, and algorithm variations.

Stay tuned for updates as we implement these features!
